# 51. A shop gives 10% discount. Calculate final price for ₹1500.
price = 1500
discount = price * 0.10
final_price = price - discount
print("Final price:", final_price)
# Approach 2
price = 1500
final_price = price * 0.90   # 100% - 10% = 90% → 0.9
print(final_price)
# Approach 3
price = 1500
price *= 0.90     # apply 10% discount
print(price)
